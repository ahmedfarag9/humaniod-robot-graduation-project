# Humaniod Robot Graduation Project

A **Humanoid Robot** Built From Scratch.

Main Tasks:

- Robot Control and Teleoperation using Depth Camera and Image Processing libraries.
- Robot Automation using ROS and Google Assistant.
- Implementing Robot Environment Awareness using Face, Object and Text Recognition Open Source Libraries.
- Automatic Environment Navigation using Senors and Actuators.
